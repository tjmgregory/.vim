# .vim/

My vim setup, making use of Vim 8's native package support and Git's submodules.

Branching can be used to switch between language support. Inspired by the wonderful [@mikesive](https://github.com/mikesive)'s [vim setup](https://github.com/mikesive/.vim).

## Setup

This requires Vim 8 or higher.

The following commands assume you're happy to lose any pre-existing configurations.

`git clone --recursive git@github.com:tjmgregory/.vim.git ~/.vim`

`echo "source ~/.vim/.vimrc" > ~/.vimrc``
